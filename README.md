# Vendor Isolator

Composer plugin to isolate project dependencies by prefixing their namespace.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or later
- [Composer v2](https://getcomposer.org/upgrade/UPGRADE-2.0.md)

## To Do

- Describe how this is different from php-scoper and other projects.

## Features and Limitations

- It only rewrites the non-development dependencies in the `vendor` directory, therefore your application code must reference the isolated dependencies by their prefixed namespace.

- It doesn't replace function definitions and calls in the global namespace. Any definitions and calls to global functions will remain in the global namespace after the transformation.
